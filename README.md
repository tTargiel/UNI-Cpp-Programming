# UNI-Cpp-Programming  

This GitHub repository is dedicated to the C++ course that I took at the University of Wrocław.  

Here, you'll find a compilation of C++ code solutions crafted to solve the exercises presented throughout the course.  
These solutions stand as a testament to the dedication and hard work that I put into mastering C++ programming concepts. With a primary focus on providing clear, concise, and effective solutions, this repository aims to aid both current students and programming enthusiasts in honing their C++ skills.  

Below you can find several solutions that I found worth mentioning:  
- [zadanie_1.cpp - Singly linked list implementation (all three exercises devoted to this topic)](https://github.com/tTargiel/UNI-Cpp-Programming/blob/main/Lista%2003/zadanie_1.cpp)  
- [zadanie_1.cpp - * operator overloading, such that it returns dot product of two std::vector<double> objects](https://github.com/tTargiel/UNI-Cpp-Programming/blob/main/Lista%2004/zadanie_1.cpp)  
- [zadanie_2.cpp - Find roots with bisection method](https://github.com/tTargiel/UNI-Cpp-Programming/blob/main/Lista%2004/zadanie_2.cpp)  
- [image.cpp - Photo editing tool written solely in C++ (add watermark, blur, flip, inflate, negative, rotate, sepia, shrink, to grayscale)](https://github.com/tTargiel/UNI-Cpp-Programming/blob/main/Lista%2005/image.cpp)  
- [my_widget.cpp - Virtual functions + Qt](https://github.com/tTargiel/UNI-Cpp-Programming/blob/main/Lista%2008/my_widget.cpp)  
- [my_widget.cpp - Lilac chaser optical illusion created in Qt](https://github.com/tTargiel/UNI-Cpp-Programming/blob/main/Lista%2009/my_widget.cpp)  
- [Bonus exercise sheet - Bitwise operations, C++ operators and "hacker" notation](https://github.com/tTargiel/UNI-Cpp-Programming/blob/main/Lista%20dodatkowa%20-%20Marzec/Tomasz%20Targiel%20-%20Lista%20dodatkowa%20-%20Marzec.pdf)
